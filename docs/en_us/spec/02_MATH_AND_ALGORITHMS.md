## 1. Overclocking & Specialized Machine Physics

GTCalcBoard strictly computes physical energy and recipe duration formulas for GregTech CEu Modern and integrated tech mods.

### 1.1 Voltage Tier Delta ($\Delta\text{Tier}$)
$$
\Delta\text{Tier} = \begin{cases} 
\max(0, \, \text{TargetTier.ordinal} - \text{RecipeTier.ordinal} - 1) & (\text{RecipeTier} = \text{ULV}) \\
\max(0, \, \text{TargetTier.ordinal} - \text{RecipeTier.ordinal}) & (\text{otherwise})
\end{cases}
$$

---

### 1.2 Overclock Mode Duration & Power Formulas

When $\Delta\text{Tier} > 0$, Energy and Speed Factors are determined as follows:

$$
\text{Energy Factor} = 4.0^{\Delta\text{Tier}}
$$

$$
\text{Speed Factor} = \begin{cases} 
2.0^{\Delta\text{Tier}} & \text{(STANDARD Mode)} \\
4.0^{\Delta\text{Tier}} & \text{(PERFECT Mode)} \\
1.0 & \text{(LOSSLESS Mode)}
\end{cases}
$$

* **STANDARD Mode**: Standard singleblock and multiblock machines ($4\times\text{power}, 2\times\text{speed per tier}$)
* **PERFECT Mode**: Perfect overclocking multiblocks ($4\times\text{power}, 4\times\text{speed per tier}$)
* **LOSSLESS Mode**: Speed unchanged, energy conserved ($1\times\text{power}, 1\times\text{speed per tier}$)

$$
\text{Calculated Duration (ticks)} = \frac{\text{BaseDurationTicks}}{\text{Speed Factor}}
$$

$$
\text{Calculated EU/t} = \text{BaseEUt} \times \text{Energy Factor}
$$

### 1.3 Sub-tick Batching & Single/Multiblock Overclock Branching ($< 1.0\text{ Tick}$)

When aggressive overclocks push calculated recipe durations below $1.0\text{ tick}$ ($0.05\text{ s}$), processing branches according to singleblock and multiblock hardware capabilities:

1. **Singleblock Machines (Early Break)**:
   Singleblock machines do not support sub-tick parallel processing. When the overclock loop reaches a duration of $1.0\text{ tick}$ or lower ($\text{duration} \le 1.0$), the overclock calculation terminates immediately (Early Break). Duration is clamped at $\max(1.0, \, \lfloor \text{duration} \rfloor) = 1.0\text{ tick}$, preventing uncontrolled power factor growth ($\text{Energy Factor}$) or EU/t spikes:

$$\text{BatchesPerTick} = 1.0, \quad \text{Effective Duration} = 1.0\text{ tick} \quad (0.05\text{ s})$$
$$\text{Cycles Per Second (CPS)} = 20.0 \times \text{Parallel} \times \text{MachineCount}$$

2. **Multiblock Machines (Subtick Parallel)**:
   Multiblocks continue to support sub-tick batching for voltage tiers exceeding the $1.0\text{ tick}$ threshold:

$$\text{BatchesPerTick} = \frac{1.0}{\text{Calculated Duration (ticks)}}, \quad \text{Effective Duration} = 1.0\text{ tick}$$
$$\text{Effective EU/t} = \text{Calculated EU/t} \times \text{BatchesPerTick}$$
$$\text{Cycles Per Second (CPS)} = 20.0 \times \text{BatchesPerTick} \times \text{Parallel} \times \text{MachineCount}$$

---

### 1.4 Hardware Addon Compounding

For all installed addons $a \in \text{InstalledAddons}$, duration and power multipliers compound multiplicatively:

$$\text{Total Duration} = \text{Effective Duration} \times \prod_{a \in \text{Addons}} a.\text{getDurationMultiplier}()$$
$$\text{Total EU/t} = \text{Effective EU/t} \times \prod_{a \in \text{Addons}} a.\text{getEutMultiplier}()$$

#### Heating Coil Machine-Specific Bonus Deduction

##### Electric Blast Furnace (EBF)
Given recipe temperature $T_{\text{recipe}}$ and coil temperature $T_{\text{coil}}$:

$$\Delta T_{\text{excess}} = \max(0, \, T_{\text{coil}} - T_{\text{recipe}})$$
$$\text{EUt Multiplier} = 0.95^{\lfloor \Delta T_{\text{excess}} / 900 \rfloor}$$

*(5% compounding power reduction per 900K excess temperature)*

##### Pyrolyse Oven
$$\text{Duration Multiplier} = \frac{100.0}{\text{PyrolyseSpeedPercent}}$$

##### Cracking Unit
$$\text{EUt Multiplier} = \frac{\text{CrackingEnergyPercent}}{100.0}$$

##### Large Chemical Reactor (LCR / ECR / ICR)
$$\text{Duration Multiplier} = \frac{100.0}{\text{ChemicalSpeedPercent}}, \quad \text{EUt Multiplier} = \frac{\text{ChemicalEnergyPercent}}{100.0}$$

##### Multi Smelter
$$\text{Parallel} = \text{SmelterParallel} \quad (32\text{x}, 64\text{x}, 128\text{x}\dots)$$

#### Large Steam/Gas/Plasma Turbine Rotor, Decoupled Tiers & Durability Formulas (ADR-006)

##### 1. Decoupled Rotor Holder & Dynamo Hatch Tiers
Given Rotor Holder tier voltage $V_{\text{holder}}$, Dynamo Hatch tier voltage $V_{\text{dynamo}}$, and amperage $A_{\text{dynamo}}$:

$$\text{Cap}_{\text{holder}} = V_{\text{holder}} \times 2.0 \quad (\text{EU/t, Flow Rate Limit})$$
$$\text{Cap}_{\text{dynamo}} = V_{\text{dynamo}} \times A_{\text{dynamo}} \quad (\text{EU/t, Power Generation Ceiling})$$
$$P_{\text{max, turbine}} = \min(\text{Cap}_{\text{holder}}, \, \text{Cap}_{\text{dynamo}})$$

##### 2. Turbine Rotor Efficiency & Generation Calculation
Given rotor efficiency $E_{\text{rotor}}$, rotor power $P_{\text{rotor}}$, rotor holder tier bonus $B_{\text{holder}} = \max(0, (\text{HolderTier} - \text{BaseTier}) \times 10\%)$, and lubricant boost multiplier $M_{\text{boost}} \in \{1.0, 1.25, 1.50\}$:

$$\text{RotorEffMult} = \max\left(1.0, \, \frac{E_{\text{rotor}}}{100.0} \times \left(1.0 + \frac{B_{\text{holder}}}{100.0}\right) \times M_{\text{boost}}\right)$$
$$\text{Calculated Output EU/t} = \min\left(P_{\text{max, turbine}}, \, \text{BaseRecipeEUt} \times \frac{P_{\text{rotor}}}{100.0} \times M_{\text{boost}}\right)$$
$$\text{Total Parallel} = \left\lfloor \frac{\text{Calculated Output EU/t}}{\text{BaseRecipeEUt}} \right\rfloor$$

##### 3. Rotor Durability Wear Rate & Lifetime ($T_{\text{lifespan}}$) Formulas
Given base durability $D_{\text{rotor}}$ and loss rate per second $\text{Loss}_{\text{sec}}$:

$$\text{Loss}_{\text{sec}} = \text{BaseLossRate} \times \left(\frac{\text{ActualFlowRate}}{\text{OptimalFlowRate}}\right) \times \frac{1.0}{M_{\text{boost}}}$$
$$T_{\text{lifespan}} = \frac{D_{\text{rotor}}}{\text{Loss}_{\text{sec}}} \quad (\text{seconds})$$
$$\text{Rotor Replacement Rate (Items/hour)} = \frac{3600.0}{T_{\text{lifespan}}} \times \text{MachineCount}$$

#### Power Supply Based Maximum Available Machine Parallel ($P_{\max}$) & Overclocking Capacity
Given equipped Energy Hatch voltage $V_{\text{hatch}}$, amperage $A_{\text{hatch}}$, and single recipe power $E_{\text{recipe}}$:
$$P_{\max} = \min\left(\text{ConfiguredParallel}, \, \left\lfloor \frac{V_{\text{hatch}} \times A_{\text{hatch}}}{E_{\text{recipe}}} \right\rfloor\right)$$
If $\text{ConfiguredParallel} > P_{\max}$, a hardware capacity warning badge is rendered on the canvas node card.

The multiblock maximum overclock tier limit ($\Delta\text{Tier}_{\max}$) scales with total power capacity ($V_{\max} = V_{\text{hatch}} \times A_{\text{hatch}}$) up to the highest voltage tier provided ($\text{capacityTier} = \text{getMaxTierProvided}(V_{\max})$), matching in-game duration, batching cycles, and throughput:
$$\Delta\text{Tier}_{\max} = \max\Big(\text{node.getTierDelta()}, \, \max\big(0, \, \text{capacityTier.ordinal()} - \text{recipeTier.ordinal()}\big)\Big)$$

For multiblock structures with single energy hatch limits ($\text{energyHatchSlotCount} = 1$, such as Rock Filtrator), at most one energy hatch may be installed and dual-hatch tier skip overclocking is disallowed.

---

### 1.5 Byproduct Tier Chance Boost & Macerator Tier Gating

$$\text{Effective Chance} = \min\Big(1.0, \, \text{BaseChance} + (\Delta\text{Tier} \times \text{TierChanceBoost})\Big)$$
$$\text{Single Machine Expected Output Rate (per sec)} = \text{Amount} \times \text{Effective Chance} \times \text{CPS}$$

* **Macerator Low-Tier Byproduct Locking**:
  For macerators operating below HV ($512\text{ EU/t}$) tier (including ore crushing `gtceu:ore_crushing` and recycling `gtceu:macerator_recycling`), byproduct chances and output rates are strictly locked to $0\%$ ($\text{Effective Chance} = 0$).

---

### 1.6 Bulking & Batch Mode Parallel Separation Invariant

Star Technology Bulking modes ($4:3.25 \sim 64:52$) and Batch Processing modes are classified as power-constant parallel multipliers:
1. **Power-Consuming Parallel ($P_{\text{power}}$)**: Incorporates physical coils/parallels and power-drawing boosts, strictly capped within energy hatch limits ($P_{\max}$).
2. **Effective Production Parallel ($P_{\text{eff}}$)**: Extends $P_{\text{power}}$ sequentially by throughput boosts, bulking ratios, and batch multipliers to derive true throughput per second.

---

### 1.7 Steam Boilers & Throttle ($\theta \in [0.25, 1.0]$)

- **Small Boilers**: LP Bronze ($120\text{ L/s} = 6\text{ mB/t}$), HP Steel ($360\text{ L/s} = 18\text{ mB/t}$)
- **Large Boilers**: Bronze ($16\text{k/s}$), Steel ($36\text{k/s}$), Titanium ($64\text{k/s}$), Tungstensteel ($128\text{k/s}$)

$$\text{Effective Speed Multiplier} = \text{TierSpeedMultiplier} \times \theta$$
$$\text{Steam Rate (mB/t)} = \text{BaseSteamRate} \times \text{Effective Speed Multiplier}$$
$$\text{Water Rate (mB/t)} = \frac{\text{Steam Rate (mB/t)}}{160.0} \quad (1\text{mB Water} \rightarrow 160\text{mB Steam})$$

---

### 1.8 GTCEu & Star Technology Multiblock Trait Physics Formulas (`MULTIBLOCK_TRAIT`)

Physics formulas for intrinsic multiblock processing modifiers and traits:

1. **Throughput Boosting (Pyrolyse Oven, Super Cracker, etc.)**:
   - Multipliers: Parallel $P_{\text{trait}} = 4$, Duration $D_{\text{mult}} = 1.6$, Power $E_{\text{mult}} = 0.95$
   - Effective Duration: $T_{\text{eff}} = T_{\text{base}} \times 1.6 \text{ (ticks)}$
   - Effective Cycles Per Second (CPS): $\text{CPS} = \frac{20}{T_{\text{eff}}} \times (P_{\text{hatch}} \times 4) = \text{CPS}_{\text{base}} \times 2.5 \quad (2.5\times \text{ speed acceleration})$
   - Single Machine Power: $\text{EUt}_{\text{single}} = \text{EUt}_{\text{base}} \times 0.95$ (Constant power parallel: $P_{\text{trait}}$ does not increase power draw)
2. **Bulk Processing (Bulk Processing Array, LOAF, etc.)**:
   - Multipliers: Parallel $P_{\text{trait}} = 16$, Duration $D_{\text{mult}} = 13.0$
   - Effective Duration: $T_{\text{eff}} = T_{\text{base}} \times 13.0 \text{ (ticks)}$
   - Effective Cycles Per Second (CPS): $\text{CPS} = \frac{20}{T_{\text{eff}}} \times (P_{\text{hatch}} \times 16) = \text{CPS}_{\text{base}} \times \frac{16}{13} \approx \text{CPS}_{\text{base}} \times 1.2308 \quad (23.08\% \text{ speed acceleration})$
3. **Overpressure Autoclave**:
   - Multipliers: Parallel $P_{\text{trait}} = 8$, Duration $D_{\text{mult}} = 1.5$, Power $E_{\text{mult}} = 1.25$
   - Effective Cycles Per Second (CPS): $\text{CPS} = \frac{20}{T_{\text{eff}}} \times (P_{\text{hatch}} \times 8) = \text{CPS}_{\text{base}} \times \frac{8}{1.5} \approx \text{CPS}_{\text{base}} \times 5.333 \quad (5.33\times \text{ speed acceleration})$
4. **Multiblock Trait Stacking**:
   For endgame multiblocks combining multiple traits (e.g. LOAF, Ultimate EBF):

$$\text{Total Parallel} = P_{\text{hatch}} \times \prod_{k} P_{\text{trait}, k}$$
$$\text{Combined Duration Multiplier} = \prod_{k} D_{\text{mult}, k}$$

   Example: `Throughput Boosting` ($4\times \text{ Par, } 1.6\times \text{ Dur}$) + `Bulk Processing` ($16\times \text{ Par, } 13.0\times \text{ Dur}$) = $64\times \text{ Parallel, } 20.8\times \text{ Duration} \Rightarrow \frac{64}{20.8} \approx 3.077\times \text{ overall speedup}$.

## 2. Modular Solver Architecture & Core Algorithms

Following Single Responsibility principles, the solver engine is structured around the `FlowGraphSolver` facade delegating to 4 specialized sub-solvers:
- `MassBalanceSolver`: Closed-loop Gauss-Jordan mass conservation linear system solver.
- `FlowBalanceMatrixSolver`: 10-pass fixed-point bottleneck relaxation, bidirectional AutoRatio BFS propagation, and integer harmonized scaling.
- `FlowGraphTopologyAnalyzer`: Directed graph topological sorting, cycle detection (`CycleDetector`), and upstream/downstream subgraph traversal.
- `FlowSummaryAggregator`: Net process balance summaries (`BalanceSummary`), total energy/power deltas, and socket flow statistics.

### [Core Engine] Closed-Loop Mass Conservation Linear Solver (`MassBalanceSolver`)

Calculates exact machine count vectors $\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N]^T$ satisfying the **Mass Conservation Law** in closed-loop recycling circuits (e.g. hydrogen recycling in ethylbenzene lines or platinum group refining cycles) using rigorous numerical linear algebra.

#### 1. Linear System Formulation
For each intermediate/final material $i$ ($1 \le i \le M$), the net balance between external demand $d_i$ and machine production/consumption matrix $S \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}$ is formulated as:

$$\sum_{j=1}^N S_{ij} x_j = d_i \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$$

where $S_{ij}$ denotes the net per-second output ($>0$) or input ($<0$) of material $i$ produced by a single machine $j$.

#### 2. Gauss-Jordan Elimination with Partial Pivoting
For numerical stability, the pivot row $p$ with the largest absolute value in column $k$ is selected and swapped at each elimination step $k$:

$$p = \arg\max_{i \ge k} |A_{ik}|$$

If $|A_{pk}| < \epsilon$ ($10^{-9}$), the system is diagnosed as singular or under-determined and seamlessly transitions to least-squares approximation or BFS heuristic fallbacks.

Elimination updates ($O(N^3)$):
$$A_{ij} \leftarrow A_{ij} - \frac{A_{ik}}{A_{kk}} A_{kj}, \quad b_i \leftarrow b_i - \frac{A_{ik}}{A_{kk}} b_k \quad (\forall i \ne k)$$

---

### [Algorithm 1] 10-Pass Fixed-Point Bottleneck Relaxation

#### Production supply and demand mode

`SUPPLY_ONLY` remains the default historical solver. The opt-in `SUPPLY_AND_DEMAND` production solve also limits a producer to its downstream acceptance. This does not replace the effective demand used by auto-ratio sizing.

Acceptance and production split weights are derived from nominal consumer capacity, discounted by downstream acceptance and structural coverage of other feeds, not by the consumer's current efficiency. A 30 B/min producer feeding consumers that accept 7.2 and 9.6 B/min runs at 56% and sends exactly those two shares. Competing producers initially share a consuming port's capacity in proportion to their nominal incoming capacities. Shared-input reservations are refined from delivered producer capacities, restarting the descending efficiency pass each time so unused reservations can be reclaimed. This matters when co-producers depend on one another: equal saltwater byproducts from an epichlorohydrin/epoxy chain must each occupy half the electrolyzer capacity, despite unequal nominal reactor speeds. Structural other-feed coverage stays nominal to avoid feeding the resulting throttles back into upstream acceptance. Refined reservations survive port-cache invalidation and are cleared on solve-mode changes. Relay chains carry appetite upstream, subtract their own external supply and add fixed drains/allocated exports. Existing explicit split modes, priorities and wire limits still control allocation.

The acceptance analysis is memoized for one graph solve, not globally. Each solve initializes independently of previously displayed throttles. Isolated recycling components use the capacity-feasible initialization described below; other nodes start at full efficiency. The graph retains its solved allocation mode for port statistics even if the process-wide board preference changes. A machine below its acceptance ceiling remains input-starved (amber); only a binding downstream limit is reported as blocked (magenta). A tied constraint is shown as blocked, provided the input actually covers the accepted rate.

Unwired/dead-ended outputs are assumed exported or vented; explicit void sinks are unbounded. Recirculating output ports retain nominal loop appetite rather than repeatedly discounting themselves; the existing supply-side loop analysis handles recirculation. Structural other-feed coverage is deliberately not a global optimization of competing feeds. These are steady-state estimates, not buffer/startup simulation or proof of a feasible schedule for every arbitrary cyclic, priority-routed network.

In the two legacy modes, isolated unfed recycling components are checked using capacity-bounded port-flow inequalities before applying the damped-loop shortcut. `ClosedLoopCapacitySolver` maximizes the sum of machine efficiencies, keeps every efficiency within its configured capacity, ensures connected input consumption is covered by edge flow, and limits total outgoing flow to actual production. Passive proportional junctions conserve incoming flow, fixed wire limits remain constraints, and surplus production is allowed. A nonzero feasible operating point seeds the ordinary supply/backpressure passes and provides internal proportional-allocation weights. This prevents a multi-path Bayer process from being zeroed merely because multiplying aggregate **nominal** resource ratios misclassifies its differently sized machines as a decaying cycle. Feasibility does not assume that all machines must run at the same efficiency, and machine counts are never changed.

This initialization applies to isolated machine/passive-junction components without external connections, module/compound semantics, stress inputs, active supply/drain/export junctions, or explicit priority/weighted routing. Other components retain the existing iterative/analytical handling. Truly lossy unfed loops remain zero: no external feed is invented. Feasible components are excluded from unfed-damped port annotations, and their solved allocation weights survive port-cache invalidation. The linear optimization is a steady-state check, not proof that an empty real-world line can start without catalyst inventory.

The lime bottleneck recommendation is measured in **both legacy modes**: add one machine to each eligible producer in turn, re-solve, and select the largest positive **median relative gain across unwired output products**. Zero-baseline products are excluded. Product selection, cost weighting and a different scoring policy are not implied. Trials restore machine counts even on failure and re-solve the original graph before returning. Weak per-graph caches include no-benefit results and compare serialized hardware, ingredient identity, full edge settings, nominal rates, external allocations and subpage content. Cosmetic layout and transient efficiencies are excluded. A cache miss still costs one solve per candidate plus baseline/restoration solves.

#### Primed production planning

Select **Primed (overflow exported)** in Settings > Production Model for a line whose recycling inventory is already charged and whose surplus can leave the line. Existing boards retain their previous mode.

`PrimedLineSolver` replaces iterative loop-gain shortcuts with one graph-wide, capacity-bounded material balance. Connected input withdrawals equal actual consumption; total outgoing transfers cannot exceed actual production. Unconnected inputs remain external feeds. Passive junctions conserve supply, external and linked supplies are bounded by their allocated rates, fixed drains reserve available feed, and wire rate limits remain hard ceilings. Compound layers retain their preceding-layer utilization ceiling. Modules use their existing exposed nominal boundary rates; this does not simulate their internal inventories.

Surplus from **wired as well as unwired** outputs is exportable and does not throttle its producer. Explicit void flags and void sinks report discarded material separately. Priming does not create an ongoing external feed: a genuinely lossy unfed cycle still has no sustainable nonzero solution. Chance outputs use expected yields, not individual random rolls.

Planning uses lexicographic objectives: fixed drains/allocated exports first, configured priority tiers and demand-proportional/equal/weighted max-min branch shares next, machine utilization next, then minimal junction imports, explicit voiding and minimal transport. Saturated branches release remaining capacity through successive water-filling objectives. These are global feasible-flow planning preferences, not a reproduction of Minecraft pipe polling order or a guarantee of a tick-level schedule.

Solved edge withdrawals survive port-cache invalidation and are cleared on mode changes. Wires and port statistics use these withdrawals rather than pretending the producer's entire output is delivered to its sole consumer. Summaries report actual external input ports and residual exported outputs independently: an unwired water input still requires imported water even if another machine exports water elsewhere on the board.

This is a sustained **primed-line planning model**, not empty-buffer startup or finite-storage simulation. It assumes overflow outlets and adequate intermediate storage. Buffer sizes, transport latency, power interruptions, stochastic starvation, and cross-page cyclic startup are not modeled. The bottleneck sweep continues to use the selected model and existing product-selection policy.

#### Historical forward-only relaxation

Iteratively converges machine steady-state utilization efficiencies ($\eta_v \in [0.0, 1.0]$) under upstream supply limits.

1. **Initialization**: Set $\eta_v^{(0)} = 1.0$ for all $v \in V$.
2. **Relaxation Iteration ($k = 1 \dots 10$)**:
   Upstream supplier effective output is $\text{Supply}_{P_j} = \text{NominalOutputRate}_{P_j} \times \eta_{P_j}^{(k-1)}$, and proportionally distributed incoming supply is calculated as:

$$\text{IncomingSupply}_i = \sum_{P_j} \min\left(\text{NominalDemand}_{C, i}, \, \text{Supply}_{P_j} \times \frac{\text{NominalDemand}_{C, i}}{\text{TotalDemand}_{P_j}}\right)$$

   Consumer machine efficiency update: $\eta_C^{(k)} = \min_{i} \left(\frac{\text{IncomingSupply}_i}{\text{NominalDemand}_{C, i}}, \, 1.0\right)$
3. **Early Termination**: Halts immediately when $\max_{v} |\eta_v^{(k)} - \eta_v^{(k-1)}| < 10^{-4}$.

---

### [Algorithm 2] Port Flow Statistics (`PortFlowStats`)

- **Input Sockets**: Deficit (`isInputDeficit`, Supply < Demand $-0.001$), Balanced (`isBalanced`, $\pm 0.001$), Surplus (`isInputSurplus`, Supply > Demand $+0.001$)
- **Output Sockets**: Surplus (`isOutputSurplus`, Production > Downstream Demand $+0.001$), Deficit (`isOutputDeficit`, Production < Downstream Demand $-0.001$)

---

### [Algorithm 3] Dual-Pass BFS Auto-Ratio

Locks the user-selected anchor node count and propagates machine counts upstream (satisfying feedstock demand) and downstream (handling byproduct production), protected by cycle safety guards ($\max(50, |V| \times 5)$, visits $\le 3$).

---

### [Algorithm 4] Process Summary & Net Balance (`BalanceSummary`)

$$\text{Net EU/t} = \sum_{g \in \text{Generators}} g.\text{getEffectiveEUt}() - \sum_{m \in \text{Consumers}} m.\text{getEffectiveEUt}()$$

$$\Delta_{\text{material}} = \sum \text{Output Rates} - \sum \text{Input Rates}$$

---

### [Algorithm 5] Target Batch ETA & Stock Depletion Time (DT) (`ProductionETACalculator`)

#### 1. Estimated Completion Time (ET)
For a terminal or reroute node with target quota $A_{\text{target}}$, net inflow rate $\text{Rate}_{\text{in}}$, and maximum upstream cycle duration $T_{\text{cycle}}$:

##### Continuous Flow Model ($T_{\text{cycle}} \le 0$)
$$T_{\text{ET}} = \frac{A_{\text{target}}}{\text{Rate}_{\text{in}}} \quad [\text{seconds}]$$

##### Discrete Machine Cycle Quantization Model ($T_{\text{cycle}} > 0$)
For single-cycle production capacity $\text{Cap}_{\text{cycle}} = \text{Rate}_{\text{in}} \times T_{\text{cycle}}$, an epsilon guard ($\epsilon = 10^{-7}$) prevents false cycle increments caused by double-precision division rounding:

$$N_{\text{cycle}} = \left\lceil \frac{A_{\text{target}}}{\text{Cap}_{\text{cycle}}} - 10^{-7} \right\rceil, \quad T_{\text{ET}} = N_{\text{cycle}} \times T_{\text{cycle}} \quad [\text{seconds}]$$

##### Total Batch Energy & Feedstock Aggregation
$$E_{\text{total}} = \sum_{n \in \text{UpstreamNodes}} \left( n.\text{getTotalEUt}() \times n.\text{getEfficiency}() \times 20 \times T_{\text{ET}} \right) \quad [\text{EU}]$$
$$C_{\text{raw}}(M) = \text{UnconnectedInputRate}(M) \times T_{\text{ET}} \quad [\text{Items / mB}]$$

#### 2. Raw Material Stock Depletion Time (DT)
For an unconnected raw feedstock junction buffer with stock amount $A_{\text{buffer}}$, total downstream outflow rate $\text{Rate}_{\text{out}}$, and downstream cycle duration $T_{\text{cycle, down}}$:

$$N_{\text{drain}} = \left\lceil \frac{A_{\text{buffer}}}{\text{Rate}_{\text{out}} \times T_{\text{cycle, down}}} - 10^{-7} \right\rceil, \quad T_{\text{DT}} = N_{\text{drain}} \times T_{\text{cycle, down}} \quad [\text{seconds}]$$

---

### [Algorithm 6] Infinite/Fixed External Supply Flow Modeling (`FlowBalanceMatrixSolver`, `FlowSummaryAggregator`) (ADR-012)

When external resource supply modes (`SupplyMode`) are configured on junction or source nodes, upstream demand backpropagation is deterministically controlled and raw deficits are neutralized:

##### 1. Infinite Supply Mode (`SupplyMode.INFINITE`)
Blocks upstream demand propagation regardless of downstream demand $D_{\text{down}}$, preventing unwarranted upstream machine scaling:

$$\text{Demand}_{\text{upstream}} = 0$$

##### 2. Fixed Rate Supply Mode (`SupplyMode.FIXED_RATE`)
Propagates only the remaining demand exceeding the fixed per-second feed rate $R_{\text{ext}}$:

$$\text{Demand}_{\text{upstream}} = \max(0.0, \, D_{\text{down}} - R_{\text{ext}})$$

##### 3. Summary Deficit Offset (`FlowSummaryAggregator`)
When compiling total unconnected raw material deficits ($\text{RawDeficit}$), subtracts effective supply from external nodes ($\min(D_{\text{down}}, R_{\text{ext}})$ or $\text{INFINITE}$) to account only for genuine net deficits.

---

### [Algorithm 7] AE2 Autocrafting Plan Evaluation & Critical Path Pipeline ETA (`Ae2CraftingPlanEvaluator`) (ADR-008)

For multi-page flowchart graphs bound to AE2 crafting patterns, calculates exact parallel execution times and pipeline latency over an $O(K)$ topologically sorted DAG:

##### 1. Single Node Batch Duration ($T_{\text{batch}}$) & Run Count ($N_{\text{runs}}$)
$$\text{EffectiveParallel} = \text{node.getParallel}() \times \text{node.getMachineCount}()$$
$$N_{\text{runs}} = \left\lceil \frac{\text{RequiredQuantity}}{\text{RecipeOutputAmount} \times \text{EffectiveParallel}} \right\rceil$$
$$T_{\text{node}} = N_{\text{runs}} \times \text{node.getEffectiveDurationSeconds}()$$

##### 2. Critical Path & Pipeline Staggering ($T_{\text{pipeline}}$)
For upstream predecessor set $\text{Pred}(u)$:

$$T_{\text{start}}(u) = \max_{p \in \text{Pred}(u)} \left( T_{\text{start}}(p) + \text{FirstBatchDuration}(p) \right)$$
$$T_{\text{finish}}(u) = T_{\text{start}}(u) + T_{\text{node}}(u)$$
$$\text{Total ETA} = \max_{u \in \text{TerminalNodes}} T_{\text{finish}}(u)$$

---

### [Algorithm 8] Hierarchical Compound Module BOM Aggregation & Machine Scaling (`MultiblockBOMCalculator`)

Accurately aggregates Bill of Materials (BOM) for flowcharts containing deeply nested compound modules (`isModule()`) and Shared Machine Pool frames (`isSharedMachineFrame()`) in a single flattened resolution pass:

##### 1. Recursive Parent Multiplier Propagation (`flattenNodesAndFrames`)
When descending from root nodes into subgraphs $G_{\text{sub}}$, the parent multiplier $P$ is compounded with the module machine count $M_{\text{module}}$:

$$P_{\text{child}} = P_{\text{parent}} \times \max(1.0, \, M_{\text{module}})$$

Upon reaching leaf node $n$, its effective machine count is scaled to $n.\text{getMachineCount}() \times P$, ensuring module container cards are excluded from BOM parts while internal operational machines scale faithfully.

##### 2. Shared Machine Frame Duty Aggregation & Ceiling Quantization
For machine nodes $\{n_1, n_2, \dots, n_k\}$ enclosed in a Shared Machine Frame, cumulative duty cycle is computed and quantized to an integral physical machine count:

$$M_{\text{req}} = \max\left(1, \, \left\lceil \sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i.\text{getMachineCount}() - 10^{-5} \right\rceil\right)$$

$M_{\text{req}}$ is assigned to the primary master node, while dependent slave nodes are pruned from duplicate BOM counts.

##### 3. Singleblock Tiered Resolution & Traceability (`usedByMachines`)
Singleblock machines resolve into tier-specific item IDs (e.g. `gtceu:lv_rock_breaker`) matching their target voltage tier, and record contributing machine labels and counts in the `usedByMachines` trace list.

### [Algorithm 9] Byproduct Void Sink & Port Void Mass Balance Formulations (`FlowBalanceMatrixSolver`, `FlowSummaryAggregator`) (ADR-019)

Integrates physical Junction void sinks (`SupplyMode.VOID_SINK`) and direct port-level void marking (`isOutputPortVoided`) to purge surplus byproducts generated in petrochem, acid refining, and catalytic loops:

##### 1. Mass Balance Formulation with Void Sinks
For any material $s$ in the process flow graph:

$$\Delta(s) = P(s) - C(s) - V(s)$$

* $P(s) = \sum \text{Produced}(s)$: Total production rate
* $C(s) = \sum \text{Consumed}(s)$: Total consumption rate
* $\text{netSurplus}(s) = \max(0, \, P(s) - C(s))$: Net surplus exceeding consumption
* $V(s) = \min\Big(\text{netSurplus}(s), \, V_{\text{marked}}(s) + V_{\text{sink}}(s)\Big)$: Effective voided flow rate
* $\text{NetOutput}(s) = \text{netSurplus}(s) - V(s)$: Final net production rate displayed in `SummaryOverlay`

##### 2. Deficit Exemption ($P(s) < C(s)$)
Materials in deficit are strictly exempt from voiding. Downstream consumers maintain absolute first-priority access to available supply; only net surplus ($\text{netSurplus} > 0$) is eligible for voiding up to $V(s)$.

##### 3. 1:N Branch Priority Isolation (`getConnectedConsumerDemand`)
In topologies where a single output port splits concurrently into normal machines and a `VOID_SINK` junction:
- `FlowBalanceMatrixSolver.getConnectedConsumerDemand()` enforces a return value of **strictly 0.0** for consumers where `consumer.isVoidSink()` is true.
- The void sink is completely excluded from the output port's total demand sum (`totalPortDemand`), mathematically preventing it from siphoning flow away from or starving (Input Starvation) legitimate downstream machines.
- Only surplus remaining after satisfying downstream consumers ($P - \sum C_{\text{normal}}$) is absorbed by the void sink ($V_{\text{sink}}$).

### [Algorithm 10] Shared Machine Pool Capacity-Driven Auto-Ratio (`CanvasGroupFrame`, `HarmonizedRatioOptimizer`) (ADR-031)

Proportionally scales processes sharing a physical machine frame to match a designated target machine capacity:

##### 1. Sum Current Operational Duty
For node set $N = \{n_1, n_2, \dots, n_k\}$ enclosed within the shared frame:

$$D_{\text{current}} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i.\text{getMachineCount}()$$

##### 2. Compute Scaling Multiplier ($S$)
Given target physical capacity $M_{\text{target}}$ (default $1.0$):

$$S = \frac{M_{\text{target}}}{D_{\text{current}}}$$

##### 3. Machine Count Updates
- **Continuous Mode (Default Click)**: Preserves decimal precision via $n_i.\text{setMachineCount}(n_i.\text{getMachineCount}() \times S)$.
- **Integer Ceiling Mode (Alt+Click)**: Quantizes to full physical machine units via $\lceil n_i.\text{getMachineCount}() \times S \rceil$.

### [Algorithm 11] Comprehensive Process Stability & Divergence Defense Matrix (`ProcessStabilityAnalyzer`) (ADR-032, ADR-033)

Detects 7 potential operational instability scenarios across closed recirculation loops and external feeds, preventing calculation runaway while attaching diagnostic metadata:

1. **Unfed Deficit Recirculation Loop**:
   When Auto-Ratio is executed on a closed cycle with self-sufficiency ratio $\rho_{\text{cycle}} < 1.0$ lacking external inputs, machine count runaway is suppressed, operational scale is frozen safely, and an amber `[⚠ Loop]` warning badge is displayed.
2. **Positive Feedback Growth Loop**:
   Detects cycles where byproduct generation exceeds consumption ($\rho_{\text{cycle}} > 1.0$), displaying a `[⚠ Growth]` badge suggesting connection to an overflow drain.
3. **Catalyst Decay Loop**:
   Identifies closed loops with fractional stoichiometric catalyst decay lacking replenishment, presenting `[⚠ Catalyst]`.
4. **Anchor Contradiction**:
   Resolves conflicting reference anchors situated along the same path by prioritizing the primary anchor and presenting `[⚠ Conflict]` with 1-click dismissal actions.
5. **Micro-Yield Defense**:
   Prevents floating-point precision overflow on recipes yielding $< 10^{-5}$ units per craft, activating `[⚠ Yield]`.

### [Algorithm 12] Junction Dynamic Buffer Wiring, Spillway Allocation & Rate Anchoring (`FlowEdgeAllocator`, `CanvasContextMenuManager`) (ADR-034)

Supports contextual wire-drag buffer instantiation and rate-anchored inverse scaling:

1. **Contextual Buffer Creation (Port Drag)**:
   Dragging a wire from an output port onto empty canvas space displays quick flyout actions to create surplus drain junctions (`SupplyMode.SURPLUS_DRAIN`), deficit supply junctions (`SupplyMode.DEFICIT_SUPPLY`), or void sinks (`SupplyMode.VOID_SINK`) with pre-calculated rates in one click.
2. **Two-Stage Spillway Flow Allocation**:
   In 1:N split graphs, supply is allocated with first priority to productive downstream machines. Only residual surplus is routed to continuous drain junctions, avoiding starvation on productive lines.
3. **Junction Flow Rate Anchoring**:
   Pinning a fixed-rate junction node as an Anchor scales connected upstream producers or downstream consumers to match the target flow rate $R_{\text{fixed}}$.

### [Algorithm 13] Two-Stage Linear Flow Balance Solver & Integer Quantization (`TwoStageLinearFlowSolver`, `GaussJordanEliminator`) (ADR-035)

Guarantees single-click deterministic mass balance convergence across coupled recirculation loops, anchors, and shared pools:

1. **Stage 1: Continuous Flow Balance Linear System ($A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$)**:
   - Constructs an augmented matrix $[A | \mathbf{b}]$ mapping unknown machine scale vector $\mathbf{x}$ against mass conservation equations $\sum_i C_{ji} x_i = 0$ and anchor constraints $x_{\text{anchor}} = S_{\text{fixed}}$.
   - Applies partial pivoting Gauss-Jordan elimination for robust numerical stability, resolving continuous scale vector $\mathbf{x}^*$ in $O(N^3)$ time.
2. **Stage 2: Integer Quantization**:
   - Applies ceiling quantization ($\lceil x_i^* \rceil$) with bottleneck-preserving scaling when integer machine counts are required.
   - Ensures multi-step closed loops converge deterministically on the first click without requiring repeated button presses.

### [Algorithm 14] Finite Batch & Target Production Yield Solver (`BatchRunSolver`)

Calculates overall process duration, raw material requirements, output yields, and energy consumption based on a finite input batch or a target production quota:

##### 1. Total Processing Duration ($T_{\text{sec}}$) Calculation
- **Finite Raw Input Mode (`BatchMode.FINITE_INPUT`)**:
  Based on specified input quantity $A_{\text{input}}$ and net consumption rate $R_{\text{consume}}$:
  $$T_{\text{sec}} = \frac{A_{\text{input}}}{R_{\text{consume}}}$$
- **Target Output Mode (`BatchMode.TARGET_OUTPUT`)**:
  Based on desired target yield $A_{\text{target}}$ and net production rate $R_{\text{produce}}$:
  $$T_{\text{sec}} = \frac{A_{\text{target}}}{R_{\text{produce}}}$$

##### 2. Integrated Material Requirements & Product Yields
Cumulative resource quantities consumed and produced across all process nodes over duration $T_{\text{sec}}$:
$$I_k = T_{\text{sec}} \times \text{RawDeficitRate}(k) \quad [\text{Items / mB}]$$
$$O_k = T_{\text{sec}} \times \text{NetSurplusRate}(k) \quad [\text{Items / mB}]$$

##### 3. Integrated Power & Total Energy
$$E_{\text{total}} = T_{\text{sec}} \times 20 \times \sum_{m \in \text{Machines}} \Big( m.\text{getEffectiveEUt}() \times m.\text{getMachineCount}() \times m.\text{getEfficiency}() \Big) \quad [\text{EU}]$$

### [Algorithm 15] Cross-Page Junction Flow Allocation Solver (`WorkspaceFlowCoordinator`, `FlowEdgeAllocator`) (ADR-064)

Extends the junction node's hierarchical priority (`priority`) and split engine across page boundaries, coordinating resource distribution between separate process pages without canvas clutter:

##### 1. Virtual Edge Integration & Hierarchical Priority Distribution
When distributing a producer junction's effective output flow $Q_{\text{out}}$, local connections (`ConnectionEdge`) and remote targets (`CrossPageExportTarget`) are unified into a single allocation pool:
- Each `CrossPageExportTarget` is converted into a virtual edge (demand $D_k = \text{remote junction total demand}$, priority $P_k$, flow cap $L_k$).
- `FlowEdgeAllocator.allocateHierarchicalPriorityEdges` fulfills higher priority tiers first, applying the junction's `FlowSplitMode` (`PROPORTIONAL` / `EQUAL`) within tied tiers.
- Allocated rates $q_k$ are dynamically injected into destination consumer junctions via `JunctionNodeRole.allocatedInputRate`.

##### 2. Workspace Dependency DAG & Topological Sorting
- `WorkspaceFlowCoordinator` builds a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ from cross-page links across all active pages in the workspace.
- Executes topological sorting using in-degree reduction to evaluate upstream producer pages before downstream consumer pages, executing each page's `FlowGraphSolver` in deterministic sequence.

##### 3. Tarjan Cycle Detection & Clamping Defense
- Evaluates strongly connected components (SCC) on the inter-page dependency graph via Tarjan's algorithm to detect circular loops of size $\ge 2$ (e.g. Page A ➔ Page B ➔ Page A).
- Clamps cross-page transferred rates on cyclic links to $0.0$, preventing infinite solver recursion and displaying a `[⚠ Circular Loop]` warning badge on involved junction cards.
