## [Unreleased]

## [2.4.0] - 2026-10-05

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where deleting a page inside the folder browser closed the browser panel, and resolved an issue where folder expanded/collapsed states reset upon closing and reopening the board.
- Fixed an issue where pages without an AE2 pattern binding were incorrectly displayed as linked in the AE2 autocrafting confirmation screen and bottleneck badges when producing matching items.
- Fixed an issue where switching tabs or adjusting machine values on boards with multiple pages caused UI freezes and frame drops, optimizing multi-page flow coordination to skip independent pages.

## [2.4.0-beta.4] - 2026-10-02

### Added
- Added support for Star Technology's 5-tier Bulk Processing modes (4:3.25, 8:6.5, 16:13, 32:26, 64:52) on compatible multiblock machines, allowing players to select the matching bulking ratio configured on their machine.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where folding nodes into a compound module while working on a shared team board incorrectly created the subpage in the player's personal board, ensuring module subpages are properly created and synchronized within the shared team workspace along with breadcrumb navigation and undo/redo support.
- Fixed an issue where the Bulk Processing trait was not detected on new Star Technology multiblock machines such as the Ultra Barrel.
- Fixed an issue where multiblock machines with high-ampere energy hatches did not fully overclock up to their total power capacity, ensuring accurate recipe duration, batching cycles, and throughput scaling matching in-game behavior.
- Fixed an issue where byproduct chances and output rates were not locked to 0% on electric macerators below HV tier for ore crushing and recycling recipes.

## [2.4.0-beta.3] - 2026-10-01

### Changed
- The default card display mode is now Expanded Card Mode instead of Slim Card Mode, allowing players to immediately adjust machine voltage tiers, overclocking, and configs directly from node cards upon initial setup.

### Added
- Added custom naming for junction nodes and a source search modal for cross-page links: players can now give junctions descriptive custom names in the junction dialog or via right-click, and search for upstream source pages or junctions by page name, junction label, or resource/fluid with real-time surplus rates in a dedicated search popup.
- Added Folder Browser and folder hierarchy support to Shared Team Workspaces: players can now organize shared team pages into folders and subfolders using the drawer browser (accessible via the `≡` button on the tab bar or the folder icon on the activity bar), add new team pages and folders, drag and drop pages into folders, rename pages/folders, and search team pages across folder trees in real time.
- Added Shared Team Workspace viewing and tab switching to the web dashboard: players can now switch between personal boards and shared team workspaces directly from the browser header, browse team pages and folders, and inspect shared boards in real time.
- Added Input/Output Bus and Hatch Tier Mode settings to the Multiblock Bill of Materials (BOM): players can now choose whether buses and hatches should match the machine's voltage tier, automatically scale down to the cheapest minimum tier required by recipe items and fluids, or force a specific tier (LV, MV, or HV) directly from the BOM dialog.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where junctions and connection wires displayed false deficit warnings even when surplus was available, which occurred because flow demands were calculated using nominal rates instead of the reduced effective consumption of downstream machines throttled by other bottlenecks.
- Fixed an issue where Shared Machine Pool frames rendered with overlapping sub-cards and missing summary headers in the web dashboard, now displaying the complete pool header, machine counts, duty cycle, power usage, and compact recipe cards just like in-game.
- Fixed an issue where multiblock machines with higher-tier item buses (such as MV buses on Rock Filtrator) calculated more buses than required by the recipe in the Bill of Materials (BOM), now dynamically calculating the exact number of buses required to satisfy the recipe items and automatically restoring extra slots to structure casings.
- Fixed an issue where the Threading configuration panel in machine settings was missing localized text for sub-tabs, helix stats, stat allocation badges, effect descriptions, and action buttons, as well as fixing a text clipping issue where multi-stat helix descriptions overflowed into the count adjustment buttons.
- Fixed an issue where cross-page linked junctions could not be configured or coordinated in shared team workspaces, and ensured strict isolation so personal boards and shared team workspaces only link within their own respective pages.
- Fixed an issue where regular items produced on a calculator board incorrectly displayed an AE2 linked page tooltip.
- Fixed an issue where cross-page linked junctions failed to combine with local producers when connected to intermediate relay junctions or terminal batch buffers, causing imported flow to be blocked at 0 mB/s.
- Fixed an issue where multiblock-exclusive recipes (such as Large Chemical Reactor recipes) were erroneously assigned singleblock machines as their default workstation and displayed singleblock machines in the switch machine dialog.
- Fixed an issue where canceling a node card resize with the Escape key did not properly restore the card's original height.
- Fixed an issue where the page settings panel repeatedly reopened whenever clicking or dragging on empty canvas areas.
- Fixed an issue where newline characters in certain tooltips (such as the frame auto-ratio button) rendered as broken [LF] glyph boxes, improving tooltip formatting and control character safety across all languages.
- Fixed an issue where Shared Machine Pool frames could not be resized while in Embedded Panel view mode, restoring resize handles, multi-edge dragging, and auto-fit.
- Fixed an issue where dragging an output port onto a Shared Machine Pool frame triggered generic wire drag cancellation instead of adding a recipe: now it automatically connects to matching existing recipes or automatically spawns the recipe into the pool just like multi-port dragging, falling back to the prefiltered recipe search dialog when multiple choices exist.
- Fixed an issue where the starting anchor of the connecting wire was misaligned with the sub-card port when dragging a wire from a port inside a Shared Machine Pool embedded panel.
- Fixed an issue where page names could not be renamed via double-click or right-click in shared team workspaces.
- Fixed an issue in Shared Team Workspaces where camera positions (pan coordinates) and zoom levels were not remembered when switching between team pages or toggling between personal and team workspace tabs.
- Fixed a network compatibility issue where clients connecting to dedicated servers running older mod versions would disconnect with an IndexOutOfBoundsException error upon login.

## [2.4.0-beta.2] - 2026-09-27

### Added
- Multi-selected machines now dynamically scope the Process Summary panel: selecting a group of machines dynamically filters the summary to show Average and Peak consumption, machine counts, and net raw materials specifically for the selection (and seamlessly returns to the full board summary when cleared), making branch cable sizing and sub-group power planning effortless.
- Added cross-page junction flow allocation: players can now link a junction on one page directly to an upstream junction on another page or export flows to remote pages with priority rules and flow caps. The Calculator Board automatically synchronizes inter-page resource supplies in real-time, displays link status and starvation indicators on junction cards, and allows 1-click jumping to the source page by clicking the linked badge.
- Added Peak Power readout in the Process Summary panel alongside Average Power: players can now clearly see both average throughput consumption (for fuel balance) and peak electrical load (for cable thickness and transformer sizing) simultaneously, preventing in-game wire burnouts caused by recipe bursts.
- Added contextual auto-connect for selected nodes: when multiple machines are selected, clicking the new '↔ Connect' button on the floating toolbar or pressing Shift+C automatically connects matching input/output ports only between the selected machines, preventing unwanted wiring to unrelated parts of large setups.
- Added a machine-centric embedded recipe panel for shared machine pools, allowing players to manage multiple time-shared recipes cleanly inside a single panel as vertical sub-cards and add recipes inline via an [+ Add Recipe] button. Supports seamless 3-tier view transitions between folded cards, embedded panels, and expanded frames, with direct wire routing to individual recipe pins.
- For recipes requiring a Programmed Circuit (such as GregTech chemical reactors), the configured circuit number is now clearly displayed as an icon next to the machine count buttons, with a tooltip indicating the required circuit configuration for in-game machine setup.

### Improved
- Cross-page sync junctions now automatically deduce and propagate their inter-page supply priority from outgoing wire priorities, ensuring high-priority downstream machines receive their required resource allocation first from upstream producer junctions.
- Linked consumer junctions now visualize the upstream source junction's total production, current usage, and available surplus in tooltips and supply dialogs, and starvation badges now display exact decimal flow rates.
- The Local Web Dashboard now visualizes cross-page linked junctions with color-coded status badges, upstream source metrics (production, usage, available surplus) in tooltips, and 1-click jumping to the source page upon clicking the badge.
- Eliminated redundant recipe re-indexing and catalog clearing when switching between singleplayer worlds and multiplayer servers, reducing memory allocation spikes (GC pressure) during world transitions while keeping the Calculator Board instantly responsive.
- Overhauled the side Inspector Panel to adapt to each node type: selecting a multiblock electric machine now provides a dedicated 'Energy Hatch' section displaying current hatch status and allowing 1-click installation or hot-swapping of default energy hatches directly from the voltage tier grid. This immediately resolves missing energy hatch warnings and updates overclocking and power consumption without opening the hardware dialog, while steam machines, boilers, and subpage modules now display streamlined controls tailored to their specific type.
- When opening the Calculator Board from an inventory, AE2 terminal, or other container screens, closing the board or pressing the open board hotkey again now returns directly to the previous screen.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue in the AE2 Crafting Confirm screen where clicking the bottleneck button for an item not linked to the Calculator Board reopened an unrelated previously viewed page, and disabled the link arrow and click interaction when no linked page exists. Also improved auto-detection to link existing board pages that produce the requested item.
- Fixed an issue where reopening the Calculator Board or reconnecting to a world caused cross-page sync junctions to lose their linked resource item/fluid and reset to an empty arrow icon.
- Fixed an issue where adding recipes from the shared machine pool embedded panel used the machine ID instead of the recipe category for search prefill, causing no recipes to be displayed.
- Fixed an issue where remote consumer junctions did not register as downstream demand or consumption on the upstream producer page, causing the producer page summary and upstream ports to show no resource consumption.
- Fixed an issue in the Junction Supply Dialog where the source page and source junction selection labels overlapped with the arrow buttons, and the selected source junction's real-time flow status was not properly displayed.
- Fixed a major frame drop (render lag) caused by redundant port calculations when viewing shared machine pools in folded card mode with many connecting wires.
- Fixed an issue where switching between multiblock machines supporting different traits (such as Electric Ore Factory and Super Electric Ore Factory) or removing trait addons caused the machine's base parallel capacity to become corrupted and double-multiplied, resulting in abnormally inflated production rates.
- Fixed an issue where typing inside EMI or external recipe viewer search bars could accidentally trigger the Calculator Board hotkey.
- Fixed an issue where switching a Dynamo to Boiler mode and cycling through alternative fluids caused duplicate output ports to accumulate when reopening the board.
- Fixed an issue where singleblock electric machines with a steam multiblock equivalent (such as Forge Hammer) incorrectly displayed an "HP Steam" tier badge.
- Fixed an issue where Steam multiblock machines incorrectly requested an LV Energy Hatch instead of a Steam Input Hatch in the Multiblock BOM (Bill of Materials) list.
- Fixed an issue where switching a multiblock machine with specialized traits (such as combustion engines or throughput boosting machines) to a singleblock machine could leave traits unpurged or result in incorrect power calculations.
- Fixed an issue where clicking the machine count adjustment buttons ([+], [/2], [x2]) in the side Inspector Panel triggered the wrong count changes.

## [2.4.0-beta.1] - 2026-09-20

### Added
- Added a Batch Run Calculator dialog, allowing players to calculate the total processing time, required raw materials, projected output yields, and energy consumption based on a finite input batch or a target production goal. Accessible via the Optimize toolbar dropdown or by clicking any resource in the Process Summary panel.
- Added a Recipe Override tab in the machine settings dialog, allowing players to manually customize base processing time, power consumption/generation, and input/output ingredient amounts for unsupported generic machines or custom processes, with one-click restoration to default recipe values.
- Added a Local Web Dashboard, allowing players to view and monitor the active calculator board in real time on a secondary monitor or web browser while building in-world. Disabled by default to save system resources, it can be enabled via the in-game Settings dialog or client config, and accessed via the Share / I/O toolbar menu or the /gtcalcboard web command.

### Improved
- Improved the Local Web Dashboard icon rendering and caching pipeline with background prewarming, browser-level asset caching, and robust texture loading to eliminate in-game stutter when viewing large factory blueprints.
- Added a Page Browser to the Local Web Dashboard, allowing players to view all pages, search by name or folder, switch blueprints freely, and toggle in-game live page tracking.
- Improved Local Web Dashboard visual rendering with dedicated item/fluid slot plates, strict vertical icon alignment, two-column port layout to prevent text overlapping, dynamic card height scaling to cleanly enclose large recipe port lists, and authentic item/fluid/machine icon rendering while stripping raw color formatting codes.
- Aligned Local Web Dashboard node card dimensions, row height, and port wire connections with in-game layout specifications, ensuring consistent spacing between adjacent machines and preventing junction pins from being overlapped.
- Added comprehensive measurement unit formatting (mB, B, kB, MB, and compact EU/t) to the Local Web Dashboard, allowing players to read fluid and power rates clearly with an instant unit toggle (Auto / B / mB) in the top toolbar.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where steam multiblock machines such as the Steam Kiln and Steam Ore Factory incorrectly triggered missing energy hatch warnings and displayed electric/maintenance hatches in machine configuration dialogs, correctly restricting compatible addons to steam hatches.
- Fixed an issue where recipes added from viewers or switched on existing nodes could lose their input and output ports.
- Fixed an issue where recipes for low-tier machines like macerators omitted input ingredient ports when added to the board.
- Fixed an issue where parallel hatches on unpowered multiblock machines were capped to low voltage limits before energy hatches were installed, accurately preserving the hatch's rated parallel multiplier (including Star Technology Theta 2's 8x buff).
