An in-game node graph calculator and flowchart editor for GregTech CEu Modern, EMI, JEI, and multi-mod ecosystems. Designed for planning and balancing complex multi-step production lines directly inside Minecraft without relying on external spreadsheets or web calculators.

---

## Features

### 1. Intuitive Node Canvas & Smart Flowcharting
- **Pluggable Recipe Viewer Integration**: Native integration with **EMI**, **JEI**, and **JEI++** via pluggable SPI, plus an offline pure vanilla fallback. Add recipes via the collapsible **Favorites Dock (`[⭐ Favorites (N) ▶]`)** or click EMI's native `[+]` button.
- **Contextual Drag-to-Search & Auto-Wiring**: Drag wires from any port onto empty canvas to instantly search matching producer or consumer recipes and auto-connect with integer ratio matching (`Shift`).
- **In-Place Recipe Switching**: Switch recipes on existing nodes with one click (`[🔄 Switch Recipe]`) without severing compatible wire connections (`IngredientStack.getId()`).
- **Selection Contextual Auto-Wiring & Dynamic Summary**: Multi-select machines to auto-wire matching ports exclusively within the selection (`Shift + C`) or inspect localized average/peak power and net materials in the dynamically scoped Process Summary panel.
- **Port Multi-Selection & Wire Bundling**: Marquee port selection box, `Ctrl`/`Shift` multi-select, and bundle dragging with real-time multi-bezier curve rendering.
- **Port Hiding & Selective Restore**: Right-click ports to hide unused I/O ports for compact machine cards, with one-click restore via hidden count badge.
- **Canvas Navigation & Subgraphs**: 16px grid snapping (`G`), quick page switcher (`Ctrl + K`), folder tree drawer, compound submodules (`Ctrl + Shift + G`), visual group frames (`Ctrl + G`), and full Undo/Redo (`Ctrl + Z` / `Ctrl + Y`).

### 2. Deep GregTech & Multi-Mod Calculation Engine
- **GregTech CEu Modern**: Full ULV~MAX voltage tiers, Standard/Perfect/Lossless overclocking, subtick CPS batching, and dual energy hatch support.
- **Hardware Addons & Multiblocks**: Deductive calculation for heating coils (temperature & duration bonuses), parallel hatches, configurable maintenance hatches, and turbine rotors.
- **Multi-Mod Energy Systems**: Kinetic calculations for **Create** & **Create: New Age** (SU, RPM, generator coils), RF/t dynamos & tier kits for **Thermal Series**, steam consumption modeling for **Systeams** / Boilers, and **TerraFirmaGreg (TFG)** Large Bronze and Steel Boilers with 9 booster fluids and dual-fuel Super Boiler mode.
- **Master Anchor & Auto-Ratio Sizing**: Designate bottleneck machines as Base Anchors to automatically scale all upstream production chains backwards using integer ceiling, with full support for expanded group frames and steady-state recirculation balancing.
- **Recipe Manual Override & Circuit Display**: Manually customize base duration, power consumption/generation, and input/output quantities in machine settings, with programmed circuit number badges displayed directly on machine cards.

### 3. Factory Multiblock BOM & Shared Machine Pools
- **Automated Multiblock Bill of Materials (BOM)**: Aggregates all multiblock and singleblock construction requirements (casings, coils, hatches, controllers) across pages, frames, and compound modules (`B` hotkey). Export shopping lists directly to EMI Recipe Tree, JEI++, or clipboard.
- **Shared Machine Pools & Embedded Recipe Panels**: Group multiple time-shared recipes inside a single machine panel as vertical sub-cards (`EMBEDDED_PANEL`) or pool frame (`Ctrl + Shift + S`), supporting 3-tier view transitions and automated duty cycle calculation.
- **Cross-Page Junction Flow Allocation**: Link consumer junctions to upstream remote pages with priority rules and flow caps, featuring real-time supply synchronization, starvation indicators, and 1-click source navigation.
- **Hardware Config Synchronization**: Synchronize voltage tiers, overclock modes, parallel counts, and addons across all enclosed machines from the frame header.

### 4. AE2 Integration & Batch Production Solvers
- **AE2 Autocrafting Integration**: Bind board pages directly to AE2 Processing Patterns (`[💠 Bind AE2 Pattern]`). Displays calculated completion times (ETA) and bottleneck overlays directly on AE2's Crafting Confirmation screen (`CraftConfirmScreen`).
- **DAG Pipeline & Critical Path ETA**: Evaluates multi-tier autocrafting jobs over a directed acyclic graph (DAG), accounting for machine parallelism, batch counts, and stage pipeline delays.
- **Batch Run Calculator**: Calculate total processing duration, required raw materials, projected output yields, and energy consumption based on finite input batches or target production goals via the Optimize menu or Process Summary panel.
- **Target Batch Quantity & Real-Time ETA**: Define batch goals (e.g. `100x`, `1,000x`, `10 B`) on goal and reroute nodes to compute remaining completion time, total energy (EU), and raw material requirements.

### 5. Real-Time Multiplayer Team Workspaces
- **Live Team Collaboration**: Design factory blueprints concurrently with teammates on dedicated servers with sub-second synchronization.
- **Team System Integration**: Native support for **FTB Teams**, **Phoenix Guilds**, and **Vanilla Scoreboard Teams**.
- **Edit Concurrency Control**: Automatic per-page edit locks and live teammate presence indicators prevent concurrent overwrite collisions, backed by automated background saving and revision history forks.

### 6. Advanced Flow Analytics & Responsive UX
- **Local Web Dashboard**: Real-time read-only board viewer and page browser for secondary monitors or web browsers (`/gtcalcboard web`), powered by an embedded local daemon with background prewarming and authentic Minecraft slot styling.
- **Flow Saturation Wire Modulation**: Dynamically modulates wire pulse animation speeds, stalls (duty cycle stutter), and RGB colors (Cyan -> Amber -> Crimson) based on real-time supply saturation ratios ($R = \text{Supply} / \text{Demand}$), with pulsing glow outlines indicating starved bottleneck machines.
- **Full-Flow PNG Clipboard Export**: One-click clipboard copy (`Share / I/O` menu) of the active canvas page as a clear, high-resolution image regardless of viewport position or zoom level.
- **Interactive 3-Track Tutorial & Academy**: 45-second starter tutorial, 4 specialized academy chapters (ratio solving, wiring, module subpages, workspace management), and contextual in-game design tips.
- **Junction Void Sink & Port-Level Voiding**: Configure Junction nodes into infinite void sinks (`SupplyMode.VOID_SINK`) or `Alt + Right-Click` output ports to absorb surplus byproducts and exclude them from net production summaries without severing topology.
- **Responsive Toolbar & Adaptive UI**: Adaptive toolbar contracts title and collapses overflow buttons on compact screens, high-density addon list view (`[▦ / ☰]`), 5-level UI font scaling (`[Aa 1.0x]`), and Level-of-Detail (LOD) rendering for large graphs (1,200+ nodes).
