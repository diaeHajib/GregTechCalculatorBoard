## [2.2.1] - 2026-09-13

### Added
- Added page-level target voltage tier settings and automatic machine provisioning, automatically upgrading singleblock machine tiers and equipping matching energy hatches on multiblock machines when adding recipes, with always-visible interactive tab and page browser badges, a dedicated page settings dialog, canvas context menu access, and the Alt+P shortcut.
- Integrated Star Technology Modular Combustion Frame (MCF) and docking combustion modules into a single macro node, allowing players to configure up to 8 docked modules with quick presets, centralize coolant consumption into a single port proportional to active modules, and calculate complete multiblock frame and module materials in the BOM.

### Improved
- Machines with native Perfect Overclock (such as Large Chemical Reactor in vanilla GTCEu) now automatically default to Perfect Overclock mode upon placement or icon switching, while preserving standard overclocking in environments where coils replace native bonuses (such as Star Technology).
- Integrated composite process module nodes into linear flow solving and auto-ratio calculations, allowing module machine counts to automatically scale to meet downstream process demand.
- Improved machine and recipe switching so that incompatible addons (such as coils or rotors) are automatically cleared, required voltage tiers are adjusted upwards to meet recipe requirements, and machine configuration windows stay in sync in real time.
- Enhanced recipe switching undo and redo actions to completely restore previous machine icons, multiblock states, installed addons, and custom parallel values.
- Preserved original recipe inputs and outputs when switching machines (such as switching between standard combustion generators and modular frames), preventing recipe loss when toggling machine types or hardware addons.
- Enhanced port tooltips for hardware-injected fluids (such as steam, cooling water, and oxidizers) with dedicated hardware auxiliary badges displaying their source addon.
- Streamlined label text and added hover tooltips in the page settings panel to prevent label truncation on the auto-equip checkbox and batch apply button.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where switching a node between junction/boundary pin and machine/module roles preserved fixed dimensions, clipping the node card.
- Fixed an issue where GregTech energy hatches could be misidentified as different voltage tiers in certain modpack naming environments.
- Fixed an issue where Modular Combustion Frame (MCF) nodes retained previous recipe fuels (such as Rocket Fuel) upon machine conversion, dynamically calculating exact fuel consumption rates from active docked module slots and displaying real-time demand in the config panel.
- Fixed an issue where installing hardware addons (such as oxygen boost or steam mode) shifted core recipe input slots, preventing existing wire connections from detaching or connecting to unintended ports.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where external recipe viewer (EMI) hotkeys intercepted text typing while the recipe search dialog is open, and prevented duplicate background caching calls during recipe reloading.
- Fixed an issue where the Throughput Boosting multiblock trait displayed as "Pyrolyse Oven" in the machine configuration dialog and cards.
- Fixed an issue where fractional power multipliers were rounded incorrectly on addon badges, and resolved an issue where Throughput Boosting's 4x parallel was mistakenly treated as extra power draw, preventing overclocking and causing excessive processing durations.
- Fixed an issue where single-energy-hatch multiblock machines (such as Rock Filtrator) could be equipped with multiple energy hatches to trigger voltage tier-skip overclocking.
- Fixed an issue where connecting a junction node in a recirculation loop could trigger false loop warnings, freeze machine rates, or cause machine counts to explode during auto-ratio calculation.

## [2.2.0-beta.4] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash when clicking team workspace tabs or switching workspaces on multiplayer servers.
- Fixed an issue in multiplayer team workspaces where players could become locked out from editing with a false lock badge showing their own name, and prevented revision conflict errors during page auto-saving.
- Fixed an issue where connected input ports in deficit incorrectly displayed throttled consumption rates instead of the nominal demand rate on machine cards.
- Fixed an issue where multi-resource recirculating loops with net decay failed to converge to steady-state and caused calculation freezes.
- Fixed an issue where multi-step recirculation loops receiving external raw materials incorrectly marked intermediate product ports as unfed damped loops and shut down machine operations.
- Fixed an issue where fractional auto-ratio scaling from a multi-product anchor machine over-scaled downstream machines to the largest output instead of respecting the limiting bottleneck.
- Improved auto-ratio optimization on recirculation loops with external feed to properly converge machine counts to loop throughput limits.

## [2.2.0-beta.3] - 2026-09-10

### Added
- Added warning badges ([⚠ Damped]) and detailed port notices for unfed damped recirculation loops, clearly alerting players when circulating processes decay to zero throughput due to missing external supplementary feed lines.

- Upgraded compound process modules to use dedicated 1:1 sub-pages with boundary input/output pins, allowing players to double-click modules to inspect and edit internal layouts, navigate back smoothly via breadcrumbs or the Escape key, and keep module sub-pages organized in a dedicated explorer section.
- Added steady-state recirculation tracking and one-click scaling for damped recycling loops, displaying a cyan circulating indicator instead of a false deficit warning when machines are stably operating on external supply, with detailed multi-flow tooltips and one-click machine scaling to steady-state capacity.

### Changed
- Overhauled boundary pins in module subpages into compact pins displaying ingredient icons alongside direction and flow rate badges, adding hover quick-deletion, inline renaming, right-click context menu actions, and a dedicated pin inspector panel.
- Improved the junction external supply dialog to display the active time unit (e.g. mB/t, mB/s) beside the input field, allowing players to enter numbers directly in their current view unit or specify explicit units (e.g. 2B, 2B/s, 100mB/t).
- Optimized background catalog access and machine recipe loading for improved interface responsiveness and stability during large process calculations.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where undoing a module collapse caused duplicate sub-pages to accumulate in the process modules list, and ensured sub-page lifecycle is cleanly restored upon redo.

- Fixed an issue where the machine icon in the header rendered incorrectly as a missing texture when folding a Shared Machine Pool frame.
- Fixed an issue where context menu items for group frames displayed unlocalized translation keys and overlapped with shortcut labels, properly synchronizing localization keys across all 4 languages and dynamically adjusting menu width.
- Fixed an issue where the target pool machine input in the group frame configuration window could not receive keyboard focus or overlapped with its label, allowing smooth mouse selection and Tab navigation between input fields.
- Fixed an issue where ports on folded Shared Machine Pool cards could not be clicked or connected with wires, and ensured internal machines are cleanly excluded from marquee selection, highlight boxes, and hover tooltips while folded.
- Fixed an issue where compressing a process group containing intermediate junction nodes into a module caused junction nodes to be treated as physical machines, creating phantom input/output ports and distorting the process summary net balance.
- Fixed an issue where compressing machines that receive both internal circulation and external supply (e.g. from a junction) into a module caused the external demand to be over-allocated to the full recipe rate, reducing module operating efficiency and creating unnecessary surplus output ports.

## [2.2.0-beta.2] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- Simplified junction node splitting to Proportional and Equal (1/N) modes while unifying priority tiering across all connection wires, satisfying higher-priority lines first and distributing flow within each tier according to the node's split mode.
- Added connection wire priority adjustment via mouse wheel scroll on canvas wires or the junction port list, complete with visual priority badges and informative wire tooltips.

### Fixed
- **Fixed Large Gas Turbine Power Output & Fuel Consumption Fallback**:
  - Fixed an issue where Large Gas Turbines erroneously fell back to HV base tier (1,024 EU/t) instead of EV (4,096 EU/t), resulting in lower calculated power output, distorted fuel consumption rates, and incorrect parallel counts.
  - Equipping a turbine rotor on a singleblock gas turbine node now automatically promotes the workstation to the large multiblock turbine.
- **Fixed Flow Allocation and Match Flow Button for Continuous Drain Junctions in Branching Networks**:
  - Fixed an issue where branching a producer's output to multiple consumers and a continuous drain junction displayed an inaccurate naive split supply rate on the junction tooltip, or caused the match flow (`[⚡]`) button to fill the entire producer output rather than the true available surplus.
  - Improved the junction configuration dialog to preserve precise decimal rates up to 4 decimal places without truncation.
- **Fixed Multi-Click Requirement on Long Recirculation Loops in Auto-Ratio**:
  - Fixed an issue where long closed recirculation loops (such as multi-step nether star crafting) required clicking the Auto-Ratio button multiple times to reach balanced machine counts and clear false-positive loop warning badges.

  - Combustion generators and rocket modules now reliably maintain their intended base generation (such as 2A UV on SRM) and physical running cycles without parallel hatch corruption.
- **Fixed Missing Auxiliary Fluid Input Slots on Combustion Engine & Rocket Modules**:
  - Fixed an issue where Star Technology combustion and rocket modules (T1–T4) and combustion engine boosters failed to generate required auxiliary fluid input slots (lubricants, oxidizers, coolants) on the node card.
  - Essential operating fluids (Lubricant, Tungsten Disulfide) and optional booster fluids (WFNA, RFNA, O₂F₂, FcSO₂, coolants) now accurately generate input slots with precise consumption rates synced to tooltips and mass balance solving.
- **Fixed Runaway Machine Count Explosion in Closed Recirculation Loops during Auto-Ratio**:
  - Fixed an issue where running Auto-Ratio on production lines containing closed byproduct recirculation loops (such as fuel desulfurization with hydrogen recycling) caused machine counts to multiply uncontrollably into millions due to cyclic feedback amplification.
  - Auto-Ratio now reliably protects closed recirculation loops from infinite scaling while accurately balancing external supply and demand.
- **Fixed Inactive Canvas Hotkeys (Alt+R, Shift+C, G) & Dropdown Esc Close**:
  - Resolved an issue where canvas keyboard shortcuts such as Auto-Ratio (`Alt+R`), Fractional Auto-Ratio (`Shift+Alt+R`), Auto-Connect (`Shift+C`), and Grid Snap toggle (`G`) did not trigger when pressed on the board.

- **Node Inspector & Process Summary Panel Alignment**:
  - Fixed an issue where the right-side Node Inspector panel and Process Summary overlay overlapped at identical screen positions.
  - The Process Summary panel now dynamically shifts to the left of the active inspector, keeping real-time flow and power balances visible during machine configuration.
- **Combustion Generator Fuel Rate Accuracy & ZPM Tier Cap**:
  - Corrected combustion generator base voltages for EV+ tiers so fluid fuel consumption rates (such as HOG) match in-game mechanics.
  - Capped combustion generator tier progression at ZPM, preventing Supreme Combustion Module from rolling over into rocket-fuel-only modules (UV) when scrolling.

  - Propagates persistent drain rates as active upstream port demand, enabling auto-ratio (`A` key / `FlowGraphSolver.autoRatioFromAnchor`) to automatically scale upstream producer machine counts to match the drain rate.
  - Resolved output port flow rate checking (`getOutputPortStats`) and tooltip calculations to accurately recognize continuous drain rates as connected consumer demand, showing correct consumed flow, deficit warnings (⚠), and balanced supply metrics.
  - Seamlessly integrated into the Flow Summary Aggregator (`FlowSummaryAggregator`) as baseline consumption, accurately offsetting upstream production for balanced net accounting.
  - Enhanced Node Cards (`NodeCardRenderer`) and Inspector Side Panel (`NodeInspectorPanel`) with orange accent styling, badges (`-rate/s`), and interactive configuration dialog support (`JunctionSupplyDialog`).
- **Target Output Rate Inverse Solver & Fractional Auto-Ratio**:
  - Added a Target Output Rate Dialog (`Ctrl + Left Click` on any output port) that automatically calculates the required machine count from a desired production rate.
  - Supports fractional expressions (e.g., `1/12s`, `1/60s`, `5/2min`) and diverse rate units (`/t`, `/s`, `/min`, `/h`, `/d`, `mB/s`, `B/min`) for instant entry without manual conversion.
  - [⚖ Auto Ratio] now supports high-precision fractional scaling up to 4 decimal places (`0.0001` precision) without forced integer ceiling rounding, accurately synchronizing slow or intermittent production lines.
- **Unified Canvas Workspace & Context-Driven Controls (RFC-025)**:
  - **Right-Click Context Menu**: Right-clicking empty canvas space opens a creation/action menu (Add Recipe, Junction, Paste, Fit View, Auto Connect, Auto Ratio). Right-clicking nodes, selections, or ports opens targeted action menus with hotkey indicators.
  - **Unreal Blueprint Navigation & Smooth Diagonal Pan**: Right-click drag pans the canvas smoothly, while stationary right-click (<4.5px) opens the context menu. Added GLFW polling-based smooth WASD/arrow key panning with inertia and damping, fully supporting diagonal movement (WA, AS, SD, WD) and Shift acceleration.
  - **Modern Compact Header Toolbar & Integrated Help Dropdown**: Redesigned the top toolbar to match modern IDE layouts: compact left controls (`[⚙ Settings]`, `[Page Name ▼]`, `[🔍 Recipe Space]`, dropdown groups for `[Optimize ▼]`, `[View ▼]`, `[I/O ▼]`, `[? Help ▼]`), and right quick actions (`[↶ Undo]`, `[↷ Redo]`, `[✕ Close]`). Dropdown menus dynamically resize to fit contents without text clipping, and toggleable view options (Rate Unit, Fluid Display, Grid Snap, Slim Card Mode) remain open on click for rapid successive adjustments. The new `[? Help ▼]` dropdown provides instant access to User Manual (📖), Basic Interactive Tutorial (▶), Advanced Tutorial (✦), and Hotkey Guide (⌨), with quick tutorial launch buttons also integrated into the Guidebook modal and Hotkey HUD header.
  - **Left Activity Side Dock**: Added a slim vertical activity dock on the left edge with instant toggles for Page/Folder Explorer (`📁`), Favorite Recipes (`⭐`), Blueprints & Templates (`📋`), Team Workspaces (`👥`), Hotkey Guide (`?`), and Settings (`⚙`), fully integrating previously floating favorite and hotkey chips into a clean side dock layout matching the RFC-025 wireframe design.
  - **Node Inspector Side Panel & Slim Card Mode**: Selecting a node opens a dedicated right-side Inspector panel for count adjustments, tier chips, overclock modes, and hardware configurations. Added a Slim Card Mode option in Settings to keep cards compact on canvas.
  - **Adaptive Bottom Status Bar**: Added an adaptive bottom bar showing selection count or total node/wire stats with quick chips (`[∑ Balance]`, `[▦ BOM]`, `[⏸ Pause]`).
- **Per-Craft Batch View Mode (`1x`)**:
  - Added a `1x` per-craft batch unit to the canvas toolbar and settings dialog unit cycling list (`/t` -> `/s` -> `/min` -> `/h` -> `/d` -> `1x`).
  - Displays raw recipe input/output amounts per single craft cycle independent of machine counts or overclocked cycles-per-second.
  - Ports with perfectly matching stoichiometric amounts display a green checkmark (`✔`), allowing instant visual verification of 1:1 chemical reaction ratios and closed recycling loops.

- **Combustion Generator Family Tier Progression & Rated Output Capping**:
  - Established seamless tier progression between singleblock combustion generators (LV, MV, HV) and multiblock combustion engines (EV LCE, IV ECE, LuV~UEV combustion modules).
  - When changing the voltage tier via node cards or the inspector panel (e.g., HV -> EV, EV -> IV), nodes automatically transition to the matching machine hardware (`LV/MV/HV Combustion Generator` ➔ `EV Large Combustion Engine` ➔ `IV Extreme Combustion Engine` ➔ `LuV+ Combustion Module`), updating the machine icon, multiblock flag, and display name simultaneously.
  - Resolved power distortion where singleblock generators produced abnormal amperage (e.g., `60A MV`) from high-energy fuels by deterministically capping output to the singleblock rated voltage (1A at that tier).
- **Combustion Engine & Modular Combustion Boosting (GTCEu & Star Technology)**:
  - Full support for GTCEu Large Combustion Engine (LCE, EV) with Oxygen boosting (1.5x power, 2x fuel parallel) and Extreme Combustion Engine (ECE, IV) with Liquid Oxygen boosting (2.0x power, 2x fuel parallel).
  - Full support for Star Technology Modular Combustion Frame (MCF) coolant multipliers (Distilled Water +20%, Deionized Water +40%, unsupplied -10%) and T1~T4 Combustion Modules with oxidizer boosting (WFNA 5x, RFNA 6x, O2F2 8x, FCSO 12x power, 2x fuel parallel).
  - Generator recipes scale power deterministically via voltage-proportional parallels without electric overclock duration reduction, preserving per-recipe batch duration (0.40s) and fuel energy density (EU/mB).

### Changed & Improved
- **Closed-Loop Recirculation Protection & Greedy Supply-Filling Allocation**:
  - Enhanced the flow balance solver to protect closed recirculation loops (e.g., chemical byproduct recycling) against feedback attenuation and rate collapse.
  - Implemented greedy demand-filling allocation to fulfill 100% of consumer requirements before distributing surplus flows.
  - Clarified port status indicators: actual shortages relative to current machine speed are flagged with amber deficit warnings (⚠), while upstream-induced speed limits are indicated by a distinct blue throttled badge (↓).
- **Pyrolyse Oven & Liquefaction Tower Coil Modifier Accuracy**:
  - Accurately computes coil temperature speed modifiers for Pyrolyse Ovens and Liquefaction Towers (+50% speed per tier above Kanthal 2700K, 0.75x speed penalty for Cupronickel).
- **Onboarding Tutorial UX Improvements & Event-Driven Decoupling**:
  - Clarified Step 1 instructions to guide players to right-click empty canvas space to open the context menu and select Recipe Search.
  - Enhanced Step 4 to visually glow existing wires and instruct players to right-click to cut the connection wire first, then Shift-drag from the junction output to the turbine input for 1:1 auto-ratio scaling.
  - Adjusted Advanced Tutorial Step 12 junction node coordinates to spawn cleanly below the Shared Machine Pool frame, preventing visual overlap with cutter machine card output slots.
  - Completely decoupled canvas wire interaction handlers from `TutorialManager` by publishing Forge `FlowGraphEvent` (WireConnected, WireDisconnected, JunctionInserted), with `TutorialManager` subscribing and reacting exclusively to tutorial-scoped graph mutations.

### Fixed
- **Electric Blast Furnace (EBF) Excess Temperature Perfect Overclock (POC)**:
  - Fixed an issue where Electric Blast Furnace (EBF) and Alloy Blast Smelter (ABS) failed to apply 1 Perfect Overclock (POC, 4x speed, 0.25 duration) per 1800K excess temperature above recipe requirement (T_machine = T_coil + 100 * max(0, Tier - 2)) and 0.95x energy discount per 900K.
- **Generator Mode Reset on Non-Turbine Power Generators**:
  - Fixed an issue where `isGenerator` was incorrectly cleared for non-turbine power generators (Combustion Engines, Dynamos) during node validation.
- **Per-Craft (`1x`) Tooltip Rate Distortion & Duplicate Suffix Bug**:
  - Fixed an issue where hovering over input/output ports in `1x` batch mode displayed distorted production rates (e.g., overclocked per-second throughput instead of per-craft batch amounts) and malformed duplicate suffixes (e.g., `(11.52 B1x)`) when holding `Shift`.
- **Coil Addon Stat Invalidation on Card Controls & Header Quick Select**:
  - Fixed an issue where changing heating coils via node card badges (`♨ [Temp]K`) or the config dialog top quick-select header failed to update machine EU/t, duration, and cycle rates until manually manipulated through the lower catalog grid.
- **Input Consumption Chance & Signed Tier Boost Calculation Bug**:
  - Fixed an issue where input ingredients with probabilistic consumption chances (e.g., Star Technology Cyclonic Sifter Netherite Reinforced Mesh with 3% consumption chance) were calculated as 100% consumed, distorting factory demand rates by up to 33x.
  - Added full support for negative tier chance boosts (e.g., -0.2%/tier reduction in mesh consumption on overclock) in domain rate solvers, recipe converters (EMI/JEI), NBT serialization, and port tooltips.
- **Junction Node Inspector Panel Distortion & Missing Supply Dialog Access**:
  - Fixed an issue where selecting a Junction/Reroute node improperly displayed machine-specific controls (machine count, voltage tier chips, overclock mode, hardware config, and power/duration stats) in the right-hand Inspector panel.
  - Implemented a dedicated junction inspector layout featuring bound ingredient preview, supply/buffer mode badges, target batch amount with ETA/DT duration badge, and total inflow/outflow/net flow statistics.
  - Added a direct `[⚙ Configure Junction]` shortcut button in the inspector panel and integrated junction configuration into the node right-click context menu to grant immediate access to external supply modes, buffer size, and port allocation limits.
- **Wire Severing Blocked by Context Menu Regression**:
  - Fixed a regression where right-clicking connection wires on the canvas opened the canvas context menu instead of cutting the wire.
  - Reordered canvas mouse event priorities so right-clicking wires severs them immediately with sound effects and undo support, while preserving canvas and node context menus for stationary right-clicks on empty canvas and node cards.
- **Group Frame & Sticky Note History (Undo / Redo) Support**:
  - Fixed an issue where creating group frames (`Ctrl+G`), shared machine frames (`Ctrl+Shift+S`), and sticky notes failed to record undo/redo history commands, preventing players from reverting newly created frames.
  - Fixed a critical loss of group frames and sticky notes when collapsing them into a compound module or grouping nodes, ensuring `GroupModuleCommand` and `ExpandModuleCommand` fully capture and restore enclosed frames and notes upon undo and redo.
  - Added undo/redo history tracking for frame and sticky note property edits (dialog saves, color cycling, sticky note deletions, and resizing).
- **Tutorial Step 12 Infinite Supply Event Detection**:
  - Resolved an issue where configuring a Junction node to Infinite Supply did not advance the tutorial step by dispatching `FlowGraphEvent.JunctionConfigured` and adding fallback detection in `FlowGraphEvent.PostSolve`.

## [2.2.0-alpha.1] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- **Greate Mod Compatibility & Kinetic Tier Integration**:
  - Added native integration for the **Greate** mod (Create + GregTech addon), bringing kinetic processing lines directly into the calculator board.
  - Full support for all 10 kinetic machine tiers: Andesite (ULV), Steel (LV), Aluminium (MV), Stainless Steel (HV), Titanium (EV), Tungstensteel (IV), Chrome (LuV), Iridium (ZPM), Osmium (UV), and Neutronium (UHV).
  - Dedicated recipe handling and speed/stress calculations for Greate Mills, Crushers, Mixers, Presses, and Saws.
  - Integrated circuit configuration (1-24) support and validation for recipes requiring circuit settings.
  - Shaft torque capacity validation: machine nodes display warning indicators when total required stress exceeds the safe capacity of the connected shaft tier.
- **High-Speed Recipe Animation Batching & Multiplier Badges**:
  - Ultra-fast recipes with cycle times under 1.0s (such as 0.05s centrifuges or extreme overclocks) now automatically bundle into smooth visual bursts at a stable 1.0s interval.
  - Flow particle pulses display multiplier badges (e.g., `2x`, `5x`, `20x`) reflecting the batched cycle count, maintaining clear readability and fluid 60 FPS rendering performance without particle overlap.
- **Junction Priority Flow Routing & Accumulation Buffers**:
  - **Fixed Rate Priority Routing**: Output connections from junction nodes can now be assigned a fixed flow limit. The flow solver fulfills fixed-rate priority consumer lines first before balancing remaining flows among unconstrained consumers.
  - **Accumulation Buffer Mode**: Junction nodes can be toggled into Accumulation Buffer mode with a configurable target batch size. The system calculates the charge duration and duty cycle, preventing false-positive starvation warnings for downstream machines running on intermittent periodic batches.
  - Input slots receiving buffered batch flows display an amber hourglass indicator (⏳) and a detailed tooltip explaining the intermittent duty cycle.
  - Redesigned the Junction Supply Dialog with a dedicated flow allocation table, fixed limit inputs, and accumulation buffer settings.

### Changed & Improved
- **Orthogonal Dual-Stream Wire Flow Modulation**:
  - Decoupled incoming feed line animations from outgoing product lines:
    - Input lines lacking sufficient supply emit an amber-to-crimson warning pulse to clearly indicate feed starvation.
    - Outgoing product lines from partially starved machines travel smoothly at speeds reduced proportionally to actual machine operating efficiency, accurately representing physical production rates rather than displaying false error pulses.
- **Page Tab Bar Width Calculation & Icon Alignment**:
  - Included pin and AE2 status icon prefixes into the exact tab width calculation in `PageTabBarWidget`, preventing title text clipping and hover hitbox drift across open tabs.
- **Hardware Addon Catalog Ordering**:
  - Added dedicated catalog comparator prioritizing reset cards, category priority, coil temperatures, and hatch tiers in machine addon selection dialogs.
- **Four-Language Localization Synchronization (i18n)**:
  - Synchronized 27 new translation keys across English, Korean, Russian, and Simplified Chinese covering Greate kinetic machine tiers, shaft overload warnings, circuit badges, junction priority routing, and batch accumulation buffers.

### Fixed
- **Star Technology Reflector Fusion Reactor Overclock Boost Scaling**:
  - Fixed an issue where equipping higher-tier reflectors (e.g. T3 or T4 on recipes requiring T2 like Duranium) on Reflector Fusion Reactors failed to apply overclock boosts, keeping production rates fixed at base speed (14.40s, 10 mB/s, 0 OC).
  - The calculation engine now accounts for the excess reflector tier delta (Installed Tier - Required Tier) and applies GTCEu 2:2 Perfect Overclocking (halving duration and doubling EU/t per tier delta), matching Star Technology's in-game behavior. Added reflector overclock boost indicators (+N OC, Nx speed) to reflector badge tooltips.
- **Star Technology Throughput Boosting (TPB) Machine Duration Integer Tick Truncation**:
  - Fixed an issue where machines with duration multipliers such as Star Technology's Industrial Accumulation Vessel (Throughput Boosting: 1.6x duration, 4x parallel) calculated fractional ticks (e.g. 2 ticks * 1.6 = 3.2 ticks -> 0.16s) instead of integer ticks (3 ticks -> 0.15s, 26.67 B/s).
  - The calculation engine now truncates post-overclock machine duration to integer ticks using floor rounding, aligning with GTCEu Modern's recipe execution engine.
- **Star Technology Large Chemical Reactor (LCR) Coil Buff Environment Isolation**:
  - Fixed an issue where Star Technology's custom heating coil speed bonus and energy discount (`Chemical Reactor: 100% Spd, 95% Energy`) were erroneously applied to Large Chemical Reactors across all modpacks (including vanilla GTCEu Modern and TFG), causing calculation discrepancies and confusing coil tooltips.
  - Coil speed and energy bonuses for Large Chemical Reactors are now strictly isolated to environments where Star Technology is loaded (`ModCompatHelper.isStarTLoaded()`), treating LCRs in vanilla GTCEu as standard multiblocks without false coil bonuses and hiding the chemical reactor line from coil tooltips.
- **Create & Greate Secondary Workstation Precedence**:
  - Resolved an issue in `EmiRecipeConverter` where Create Basin and Blaze Burner blocks were erroneously selected as the primary workstation icon for mixer and press recipes instead of the actual mechanical machine.
